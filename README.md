# Be-Novative demo

## Requirements
- Node 8.6
- NPM 5

## Installation
1. Run `npm install` in the project directory
2. Run `npm install` in the `mock-api` directory
3. Run `npm start` in the project directory. The UI is available at `http://localhost:3000`, while the mock API is available at `http://localhost:3001`. (The price of running a single script is that both logs will share the same terminal.)

## Tools used
- React 16, React Router 4
- Axios, Path-to-regexp
- Lodash
- Webpack, Babel
- Experimented with Aphrodite for styling components
- API: HapiJS and related plugins (Joi, Boom)

## Components
- Stateful: `EmployeeList`, `EmployeeEditor`
- Stateless: `App`, `EmployeeCard`

## Notes
- Employees have `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, and `slug` props.
- Employees must have unique email addresses.
- Slugs are generated by the API based on the first and last names, and are used as unique IDs.
- If people have identical names, their slugs will have increments, e.g. `john-doe-2`.

## Potential improvements
- Minifying and code splitting for production
- Considering Redux
- Unit tests including snapshots with Jest
- Typing interfaces with Flow
